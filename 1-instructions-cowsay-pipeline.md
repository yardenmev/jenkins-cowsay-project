# Cowsay Pipeline
Today you will create a CI/CD pipeline for Cowsay.
​
## Tasks
1. (Dev) Development setup:
   1.1. Register/recieve a user on our course GitLab server.
   1.2. Create a new GitLab repository (name it `cowsay-<your_name>`) and upload the Cowsay sources to a new repository.
​
2. (DevOps) Write a Jenkins pipeline (name it `Cowsay - <your_name>`):
   2.1. Register/recieve a user on our course GitLab and Jenkins servers.
   2.2. Write a Jenkins pipeline that:
   2.2.1. Builds Cowsay's image. Make sure to tag it also with your name (`cowsay:<your_name>`).
   2.2.2. Publishes (pushes) to our private Docker image registry (details will be shared by instructor).
   2.2.3. Deploys on a static EC2 instance (for now, just `scp` a bash script and call it with `ssh`) - the bash script should contain instructions for pulling and running the image.
          Note: The instance has forwarded (open) ports `3000-5000`.
   2.2.4. Executes a simple end-to-end test using `curl` (to the EC2 instance).
   2.3. Automation of your pipeline - trigger a build of the job on each commit pushed to `main` branch.
​
3. Bonus:
   3.1. Write a Kubernetes deployment and service YAML manifest for Cowsay and add them to the repository.
   3.2. Upgrade your pipeline to deploy to your Kubernetes cluster instead of EC2.
